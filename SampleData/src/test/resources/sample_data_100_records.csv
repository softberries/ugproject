For starters, the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything, most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn (this is a hypothetical dream build after all) why not get the one with the fanciest interior?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory.

We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. 

Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is) ",NA,0,1,"t1_cquewht"

I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic. 

I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's, bought Silva for the LB, luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there. ",NA,1430438623,0,"t3_34gh7l"

I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.

From my coworkers reactions I'd guess it's just efficient zombie mode.  What I notice more often is that I'm physically tired.  Still alert enough mentally.  Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   

Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?  In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice.  I get more done.  And that's translated into spending more time at work.  $$$  In terms of quality, it's kind of blah.
