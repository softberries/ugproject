They don't want change. \n\nThe black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. \n\nWhat do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals?

The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. \n\nHow do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. \n\nBecause when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you.

Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8\" but then you go back and think about it a little \"Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show, fuck! It's not even a 6, the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!\"\n\nI wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.\n\nOf course all of this is probably overanalyzing on **my** part but it probably went somewhat like that.","name":"t1_cqug92d","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t1_cqufskw","id2":"cqug92d","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"1","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh22","id":"70","author_flair_css_class":"NA","author_flair_text":"NA","ups":"1","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34gb0n","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438402","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"movies","author":"PoopyVampire","body":"Holy shit, I couldn't tell if some of those scenes were sped up or they were actually moving that fast.\n\nI need to watch more Martial Arts movies!","name":"t1_cqug92e","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t3_34cvv6","id2":"cqug92e","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"2","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","id":"71","author_flair_css_class":"NA","author_flair_text":"NA","ups":"2","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34cvv6","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438402","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"ApocalypseRising","author":"TheNoobSlayer5674","body":"so fucking inspirational ","name":"t1_cqug92f","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t3_34gkf7","id2":"cqug92f","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"2","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2umo5","id":"72","author_flair_css_class":"AAAGuardian","author_flair_text":"","ups":"2","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34gkf7","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438402","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"minecraftskins","author":"ErickCachorroZL157","body":"ErickCachorroZL157","name":"t1_cqug92g","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t3_34gmtr","id2":"cqug92g","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"-1","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2sr18","id":"73","author_flair_css_class":"NA","author_flair_text":"NA","ups":"-1","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34gmtr","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438403","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"deathgrips","author":"eyeofnoble","body":"i'm pretty sure the line is \"we ain't broke, on tour\" because of the misconception that they had broken up, despite tweeting that they hadn't, in addition to tweeting \"we're going on tour\"","name":"t1_cqug92h","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t3_34gh3h","id2":"cqug92h","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"2","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2tr22","id":"74","author_flair_css_class":"","author_flair_text":"her vox limbo fine print in obese sharpie so sorry falsetto","ups":"2","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34gh3h","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438403","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"fantasybaseball","author":"ndemerson","body":"I'd do it, because, well...fish.","name":"t1_cqug92i","removal_reason":"NA","parent_id":"t1_cqug7ex","id2":"cqug92i","archived":"0","distinguished":"NA","score":"1","downs":"0","score_hidden":"0","subreddit_id":"t5_2quxe","id":"75","author_flair_css_class":"LeagueFlair","author_flair_text":"10 Team - H2H Points - 3 Keepers","ups":"1","controversiality":"0","edited":"0","link_id":"t3_34dy9y","retrieved_on":"1432703080","created_utc":"1430438403","gilded":"0"},{"subreddit":"razer","author":"electricjesus264","body":"Download razer surround.

Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?  In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice.
