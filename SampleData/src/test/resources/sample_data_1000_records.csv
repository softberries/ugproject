For starters, the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything, most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn (this is a hypothetical dream build after all) why not get the one with the fanciest interior?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory.

We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. 

Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is) ",NA,0,1,"t1_cquewht"

I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing.

Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   

Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?

Original Post:

**Boss required me to sign a document waiving my right take a lunch/breaks. Help /r/legaladvice!**

&gt; I work in the food service industry in Seattle, and have been with my current company for about 5 years. Back in December, every member of our customer service staff (it's a small corporate chain, less than 200 employees) was required to sign [this document](http://imgur.com/iwa6IEQ), or else have all of our shifts cut to 4 hours each in length or less.  I work for minimum wage, and have never been offered or granted a raise by this company when I've asked.  I'm not passionate about my currently line of work, but my personal sense of justice feels violated to the point of needing to put my foot down.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you're thinking: ""Get a new job!"" And yes, I'm in the process of looking for another job using other skills. A few of my coworkers are like family to me.  While I might be able to leave the situation, they aren't as fortunate, and that frustration bugs me to no end. The management at this company has stepped over the line of reason, and I'm not sure what legal recourse to utilize, or where to start.
&gt; 
&gt; -I know that their encouraging me to sign this document is illegal.
&gt; -I also know that I would lose my job if my employer read this post (as such, I've removed the header from the document)
&gt;

Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.

Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.

Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.

The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...

The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.

I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.",NA,0,0,"t3_34ffhl"

Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.

For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.",NA,1430439135,0,"t1_cqtrbfr"

I'm happy with the AppRadio, but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features.


I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.


Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.

So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.

We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted). 

I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.

* 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC
* 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC
* 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC

Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed.

---
&gt;Amy is a klutzy girly-girl who likes to party a lot and is flexible in being wooed by men. She is kind of spoiled due to her parents being rich and she once used to look down on the poor. She has a sense of justice and patriotism but gets frustrated a lot when she is in desperate and hard situations. She constantly gets guilt ridden when she does something wrong. She is also naive and falls for many things. Amy might also be bad at placing and losing things such as failing to hide her wallet in her pocket fully only to get it stolen by people like Bender. She is also rebellious against her parents in their many schemes such as their plot to destroy twelve percent of the Milky way to build a giant mini golf course.

It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later.

But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.

I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.

I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.

At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying.",NA,1430550304,0,"t3_34fw71"

'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.

Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you.

&gt; The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.

I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that.

I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.

&gt; It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.

For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - ""argument against the man"") I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way.

You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe, I don't know. But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.

Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.

&gt; As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.

You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.

You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.

Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard, though?

Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.

If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?

If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.

So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.

&gt; It's not being an asshole to say your mind.

Never said it was.

&gt; It's not being a douchebag to complain.

It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day. Could be plenty of things.

But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation.

Going to Reddit? Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.

But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.

&gt; It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.

You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now.

&gt; And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say ""Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."".

In other words, you're self-entitled.

Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this.

""Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this. 

It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too. I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.""

Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.00 by themselves the *majority* of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League. 

If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?

*And* it has micro transactions?

Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.",NA,0,0,"t1_cqufjqu"

any good striker Bader cant consistently take down outclasses him on the feet, that would definitely be the case with Rumble, i dont know if you know this but Rumble has great Takedown defense; 85% and Davis couldnt do anything vs him, I doubt Cormier will be able to just lie on him, he might be able to take him down a couple times but its also going to be stand up fight and Cormier could actually win and would be a deserving champ unlike Bader imo

out of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling, his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good, he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won, the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader",NA,0,0,"t1_cqufugm"

Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:

* Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.

* You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.

* Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.

* Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.

* Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.

* You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.

I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it.

The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, charisma) and your proficiency bonus.

Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level, and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background.

Your ability scores are generated when you make your character, and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook, but a quick google search should tell you how it works, as lots of systems, such as pathfinder, and even older versions of D&amp;D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school, and take 4 six sided die, roll them all, drop the lowest die, and add the rest together

The ""bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about, not the actual score itself, and is determined by taking the score, dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12, is a bonus of +1, but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 (note, always round down for this, so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0)

But in terms of presentation he was never a great sell, same as Myerson. Nadella and Belfiore have the presenting chops to be more plausible ~~footmen... ah duck it done typing on this shot windows touch keyboard and shut reddhubb app, ill find my android tablet and finish this post~~ frontmen. 

(phew, back on a usable small-tablet keyboard / reddit app)

The only thing that's changed is the perception of those guys at the top, which is important for your regular joe - like the OP, clearly - who judges by how plausible someone looks. It's why Yahoo has Mayer as CEO, it's why a legion of US corporates are headed up by sharp-looking dudes in their 50's, and it's why Apple wouldn't have been the Apple it is now without Jobs. Bald, bug-eyed Ballmer with his sweat stains and strained nerd voice wasn't going to cut it as a frontman in this hyper-self-absorbed age however good his leadership skills were. And they *were* good despite his misses. 

Nadella has only just started putting his own stamp on the company and is currently riding high on Ballmer's legacy.

Case in point - I hated math at a younger age, until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching.
